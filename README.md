# Greynoise Python Wrapper.

A python 2.7 wrapper for greynoise v2 API.

Available Functions

- **test_connect** - Provides a method to test connectivity
- quick_ip Check whether a given IP address is Internet background noise, or has been observed scanning or attacking devices across the Internet.
- **get_bulk** - Get all noise IPs from today generated by internet scanners, search engines, and worms
- **get_bulk_date** - Get all noise IPs from on a given day generated by internet scanners, search engines, and worms. Date format is 2018-01-01 / YYYY-MM-DD.
- **get_quick_ip** - Check whether a given IP address is Internet background noise, or has been observed scanning or attacking devices across the Internet.
- **get_context_ip** - Get more information about a given IP address. Returns time ranges, IP metadata (network owner, ASN,reverse DNS pointer, country), associated actors, activity tags, and raw port scan and web request information.
 
### test_connect

**Function**
Test ping to Grey Noise API

**Parameters**
None: Relies on API key being set. Returns True for successful connection and False for unsuccessful.

**Usage**
s = greyNoise(api_key='yourapikey')
s.test_connect()

### get_context_ip

**Function** 
Get all noise IPs from today generated by internet scanners, search engines, and worms

**Parameters**
ip - format is ipv4.

**Notes**
- This results from this API endpoint are delivered in pages using an offset
- The complete parameter willread true once allresults have been delivered
- This API endpoint is real-time. Refresh it multiple times throughout the day to get the most up-to-date data
- An IP delivered via this endpoint does not include a malicious orbenign categorization

**Usage**
s = greyNoise(api_key='yourapikey')
s.get_context_ip('51.6.119.216')

### get_quick_ip
Function: Check whether a given IP address is Internet background noise, or has been observed scanning or attacking devices across the Internet.
**Parameters**
ip - format is ipv4.

**Notes**
- This API endpoint is real-time
- This API endpoint contains a code which correlates to why GreyNoise labeled the IP as noise
- An IP delivered via this endpoint does not include a malicious or benign categorizations

**Usage**
s = greyNoise(api_key='yourapikey')
s.get_quick_ip('51.6.119.216')

### get_bulk_date
Function: Get all noise IPs from on a given day generated by internet scanners, search engines, and worms.
**Parameters**
date - format is 2018-01-01.

**Notes**
- This results from this API endpoint are delivered in pages using an offset
- An IP delivered via this endpoint does not include a malicious or benign categorization
- The complete parameter willread true once allresults have been delivered
- Date format is YYYY-MM-DD

**Usage**
s = greyNoise(api_key='yourapikey')
s.get_bulk_date("2018-01-01")

### get_bulk

**Parameters**
None

**Function**
Get all noise IPs from today generated by internet scanners, search engines, and worms

**Notes**
- This results from this API endpoint are delivered in pages using an offset
- The complete parameter willread true once allresults have been delivered
- This API endpoint is real-time. Refresh it multiple times throughout the day to get the most up-to-date data
- An IP delivered via this endpoint does not include a malicious or benign categorization

**Usage**
s = greyNoise(api_key='yourapikey')
s.get_bulk()
